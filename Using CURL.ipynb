    "# Using cURL to work with the Db2 Console\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains examples of how to setup and manage the Db2 Data Management Console using cURL. \n",
    "\n",
    "cURL is a command-line tool for getting or sending data, including files, using URL syntax. The name stands for \"Client URL\". It is particularly useful to write simple scripts to access the RESTful APIs of the Db2 Console. In this example we include cURL calls in a BASH script. The script constructs the URLs that contain the RESTful calls, then submits them to the Db2 Console's communication port. If you don't have access to a Jupyter Notebook environment, CURL is a simple way to get started with the Db2 Console APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in the User Interface is also available through an open and fully documented RESTful Services API. The full set of APIs are documented as part of the Db2 Data Management Console user interface. In this hands on lab you can connect to the documentation directly through this link: [Db2 Data Management Console RESTful APIs](http://localhost:11080/dbapi/api/index_enterprise.html). \n",

    "\n",
    "Each request is constructed of several parts. First, you need to identify the URL of the service. For example: <code>http://localhost:11080</code>. In this example, we assume that the console service is running on the same machine as the Jupyter notebook but it can be remote. Port **11080** is typical for running an unsecured connection. (11081 for https). \n",
    "\n",
    "You then need to identify the API and the API version. In this case <code>dbapi/v4</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of the call identifies the REST request and the options. For example <code>'/metrics/applications/connections/current/list'</code>. This is followed by more options separated by an <code>&</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a complete call might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>http://9.30.210.195:11080/dbapi/v4/metrics/applications/connections?end=1579643744759&include_sys=false&limit=100&offset=0&sort=-application_handle&start=1579640144759</code>\n",
